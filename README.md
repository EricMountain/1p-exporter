# 1p-exporter — 1Password vault exporter and secure local backup

## Overview

1p-exporter exports all your 1Password vaults/items to local files, packages them into a timestamped archive, and optionally encrypts that archive client‑side. It produces machine‑readable JSON and human‑readable Markdown, stores a `manifest.json` with checksums, and provides helpers for safe passphrase storage.

Note: the Python import package name remains `onep_exporter` (use `import onep_exporter`); the user-facing project/CLI name is `1p-exporter`.

## Features

- Export vaults/items using the `op` CLI (requires sign‑in or `OP_SESSION_*`)
- Per‑vault `JSON` and `Markdown` exports
- Attachment download (best‑effort) and `manifest.json` with SHA256 checksums
- Optional client‑side encryption with `age` (recommended) or symmetric `gpg`
- Interactive `init` flow and persistent configuration (`~/.config/1p-exporter/config.json`)
- Helpers to store/retrieve passphrases in 1Password or macOS Keychain (Touch ID supported)

## Prerequisites

- `op` — 1Password CLI
- `age` and/or `gpg` — for encryption (install via Homebrew or your distro package manager)
- macOS: `security` CLI (built‑in) or Python `keyring` for Keychain integration

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

Sign in (interactive):

```bash
op signin <your-domain>
# or
1p-exporter init --signin
```

Run a backup (unencrypted):

```bash
1p-exporter backup --output ~/onep-backups
```

Verify the backup:

```bash
1p-exporter verify ~/onep-backups/<timestamp>/manifest.json
```

## Interactive setup & helpers

- `1p-exporter init` — interactive configuration; can generate/store an `age` passphrase in 1Password or Keychain and persists defaults.
- Programmatic helpers: `configure_interactive()`, `init_setup()`, `OpExporter.signin_interactive()`

## Encryption

- `gpg` (symmetric): passphrase via `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` env or prompt.
- `age` (recommended): supports passphrase recipients and public‑key recipients.
  - `--age-pass-source` may be `env`, `prompt`, `1password`, or `keychain`.
  - If the passphrase is present in multiple stores (1Password, Keychain, or the `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` env), 1p-exporter will verify they are identical and will abort if they differ.
  - Use `--sync-passphrase-from-1password` to treat the value in 1Password as authoritative and copy it to other configured stores (keychain/ENV) before encrypting.
  - Use `--age-recipients` to include public recipients (e.g. YubiKey‑backed identities).
  *Note:* age does **not** allow combining an explicit recipient list with the
  `--passphrase` mode.  1p‑exporter will abort if both a passphrase is
  configured (via env/1password/keychain) and one or more recipients are
  specified; pick one method or remove the undesired value from your
  configuration.  (If `pass_source` is set to `prompt` and recipients are present,
  the prompt is skipped – the recipient list takes precedence.)  The
  `doctor` command also checks for conflicting settings and will report an
  error before you run a backup.
Examples:

```bash
# age passphrase from a 1Password item (field defaults to "passphrase")
1p-exporter backup --encrypt age --age-pass-source 1password --age-pass-item "Backup Passphrase"

# age passphrase from macOS Keychain (Touch ID may prompt)
1p-exporter backup --encrypt age --age-pass-source keychain
```

By default the tool looks for a field named **passphrase** in the referenced
1Password item.  You can override it with the `--age-pass-field` CLI option or
`age.pass_field` in the config; if you specify a name and the field is not
found or no field name is provided, the backup will abort.

## Configuration

- Default config file: `~/.config/1p-exporter/config.json`
- Override with: `ONEP_EXPORTER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json`
- CLI flags override saved config values.

Sample saved config keys: `output_base`, `formats`, `encrypt`, `download_attachments`, and `age` (contains pass_source, pass_item, recipients, keychain settings).

See `examples/config.example.json` for a ready-to-copy sample configuration.

## Security notes

- Prefer `age` with both a passphrase and a YubiKey/public‑recipient for layered recovery.
- When storing passphrases in 1Password, restrict item/vault access and rotate regularly.
- The config file stores references (item titles, recipient strings) — secret values are stored only if you explicitly choose 1Password/Keychain storage.

## Commands (summary)

- `1p-exporter init` — interactive setup and optional passphrase storage
- `1p-exporter backup [--encrypt age|gpg|none]` — run export (CLI overrides config)
- `1p-exporter verify <manifest.json>` — verify manifest integrity
- `1p-exporter query list <regexp> [--dir DIR] [--age-identity PATH] [--age-passphrase PASS]` — inspect existing exports and print item titles that match the given regular expression (default directory is current working directory).  When the target is an encrypted archive the command will attempt to decrypt it using the `age` tool.  Decryption credentials may be provided in several ways:
  * `--age-identity PATH` (repeatable) or `AGE_IDENTITIES` env var – path(s) to age identity file(s).
  * `--age-passphrase PASS` or `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` env var – symmetric passphrase (user will need to supply it manually since age does not support non‑interactive passphrase input).
  * **automatic lookup** – if no credentials are supplied the tool will consult your saved configuration and, if you previously stored an age private key/passphrase in 1Password or the macOS keychain, it will fetch them and use them transparently.


### Query examples

```bash
# find every exported item whose title contains "github"
1p-exporter query list github --dir ~/onep-backups/20250101T120000Z
```

- `1p-exporter query list <regexp> [--dir DIR]` — search exported JSON files for item titles matching a regular expression

## Development & tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

### Development environment (direnv)

- A `.envrc` is provided in the project root to automatically add `src/` to `PYTHONPATH` and expose the project's `.venv/bin` on `PATH`.
- After installing `direnv` and adding its shell hook to your shell, run:

```bash
direnv allow
```

You can still run the package without direnv using `PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m onep_exporter ...`.

## Setup

### MacOS

- Ensure `op` is installed
  - `brew install 1password-cli`
- [Setup](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/#set-up-the-app-integration) the `op` to `1Password` integration
- Run `op account add`: should report 1Password CLI is connected with the 1Password app.
- Run `op signin`: should be prompted to authorise 1Password access.
- `python -m onep_exporter doctor`
  - Need `age` and `op` installed. It's OK if the `config` is missing at this point.
- `python -m onep_exporter init`
  - Accept all defaults
  - `doctor` run at the end should be all green
